# AgriProfit ML Implementation Plan

## Start Date: Week 5-6 (After MVP Launch)

## Framework: 4-Task Evaluation Approach

### Task 1: Price Direction (75-80% target)
- Model: XGBoost/Random Forest
- Output: UP, DOWN, STABLE
- Timeline: Week 5

### Task 2: Price Bands (85-90% target) ⭐
- Model: Quantile Regression
- Output: [P25, P50, P75]
- Timeline: Week 6

### Task 3: Crop Ranking (85-90% top-2)
- Model: Ranking algorithm
- Output: Sorted crop list
- Timeline: Week 7

### Task 4: Risk Detection (90%+ recall)
- Model: Classification
- Output: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH
- Timeline: Week 5

## Prerequisites:
